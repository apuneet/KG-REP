Follow the steps given below to generate the QSMRQ queries against fb15k knowledge graph.

Prerequisites:
1.  Python Environment as described in -
2.  WORK_DIR environment variable has been set
3.  Go to folder KG-REP/, after downloading the code from github

Step-1: run python gen/get_single_path_data.py -
        this generates single file per path type in folder WORK_DIR/<data package name>/wip-data/query_prep/2_single_paths

Step-2: run gen/get_path_pairs.py - this will generate files in folder
        WORK_DIR/<data package name>/wip-data/query_prep/3_path_pair_data
        Filename - Film-6-1.csv will indicate that target is Film, and its a combination of the path 1 and path 6 of
        templates present in 1_single_path_templates.
        This file will contain - e1, r1, e2, r2, e3

Step-3: Then run python gen/generate_questions.py to generate questions, this program takes
        templates as input, and also takes files such as Film-6-1.csv as input to generate these questions.
