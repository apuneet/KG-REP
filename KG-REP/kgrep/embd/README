For running the following programs, first run without any arguments, it will then show a help document on how to run
that program.

1.  Open the file run_conf/ere_fb15k.conf. Change the parameters, if required.

2.  To perform random walk on the knowledge graph
    Run python kgrep/run_ere.py, this will create a file ere.txt

3.  To run word2vec on the random walk file
    Run python kgrep/run_w2v.py, this will create the ere embedding file
    Parameters of word2vec can be modified in the program itself, i.e., line number 61 to 65 in kgrep/run_w2v.py

4.  Create a file containing all questions, named all_queries.txt,
    copy it in WORK_DIR/<data package name>/input_data/
    this file will be used for ensuring that all word embeddings are picked

5.  The glove embedding contains 400,000 embeddings. Not all are needed for our model.
    If we try to load all, the system becomes slow. So this step is used for picking related embeddings only.
    Run python glove/pick_related_embedding.py,
    this will create a file named WORK_DIR/<data package name>/model/ere-glove/glove.txt

6.  If all the relations used in the data are not present in the knowledge graph, embeddings of those relations
    will not be present in the output of word2vec (see step 3 above)
    We therefore need to attach random embeddings for those relationships.
    Run python kgrep/choose_graph_embed.py

    This step is optional, i.e., if all relations are already present in knowledge graph, we don't run this step.
    If you don't run this step, copy the file generated by step-3 in WORK_DIR/<data pachage name>/mode/ere-glove/

7.  In the final step, we merge the glove embeddings and ere embeddings.
    1. ere-embedding - as generated by step 6
    2. Glove embedding - as generated by step 5
    For this run python kgrep.embd.merge_embedding.py
